Changes to version 0.4.1
------------------------
- SCL parser/code generator is more tolerant
- ubrcb supports resv handling
- fixed problems in presentation layer
- fixed problems when running on 64 bit systems 


Changes to version 0.4.0.2
--------------------------
- removed too strict requirements in accepting session layer accept message client side.
- fixed memory management bugs in client and server.


Changes to version 0.4.0.1
--------------------------
- fixed problem in client association request message in new presentation layer code
- MMS read access to GoCB and control objects is now more flexibel to be compatible with more clients

Changes to version 0.4
----------------------
- GOOSE publisher for windows based on winpcap
- GOOSE subscriber for linux and windows
- Started to implement a IEC 61850 client API (supported functions yet: read/write variables, simple model discovery functions, support for receiving reports)
- reimplemented presentation layer and ACSE for more efficient memory handling.
- changed error handling in MMS client

Changes to version 0.3.3.1
--------------------------
- fixed bug in MMS client that causes a segmentation fault when the connection to the server cannot be established.

Changes to version 0.3.3
------------------------
- added facility to observe write access to individual data attributes.
- added experimental GOOSE publisher code for Linux. The server also exposes configuration parameters with the GoCB.
- Server now respects the "BufTm" parameter as set by the client or SCL file. This allows related events to be accumulated for the period of time specified by "BufTm" and reported in a single report message.

Changes to version 0.3.2
------------------------
- added support functions for MMS time types (MMS_BINARY_TIME and MMS_UTC_TIME).
- improved server side support for reporting. Reports can now contain TimeOfEntry values. The server now
respects most of the options for reports set by the client.
- added Semaphore functions to HAL API (thread.h). Semaphores are used by the server stack for internal
synchonization.
- fixed bugs in code that is responsible for remote access to report control blocks.
- fixed bug in COTP code when TPDU size is larger than 1024 bytes. TPDU size can now be as large as 16384 bytes.
- fixed bug in Hal_getTimeInMs function for Windows. Window filetime value will now be correctly converted.
- fixed problems with read access to complex array types (arrays of constructed attribute classes).

Changes to version 0.3.1
------------------------
- improved support for reporting - more options are possible, reason code can be included in reports
- basic support for control model (operate) in server and server API
- added server example for control model (server_example3)

Changes to version 0.3
----------------------
- change server API, access to data model via handles
- SCL file parser supports buffered and unbuffered report control blocks
- server support for unbuffered reporting (supported triggers are GI, integrity and value update)
- MMS client support for MMS information reports
- MMS stack supports fragmented transmission for MMS getNameList service
- new structure for examples directory -> each example is in its own directory and has its own Makefile
- server support for additional ACSI types -> better support for IEC 61850 data models
- server enforces write access restrictions to the IEC 61850 data model based on functional constraints.
- added support for TCP keepalive
- and a lot of bug fixes

Changes to version 0.2.1
------------------------
- fixed bug in SCL file parser
- Added doxygen generated documentation to source distribution
- some bug fixes


Changes to version 0.2
-----------------------
- Support for association specific data sets (named variable lists)
- Support for permanent data sets configured in SCL file
- fixed bug when deleting data sets
- data sets can now contain variables of different MMS domains (IEC 61850 logical devices)
- Changed handling of MMS GetNameList service in MMS client API

Changes to version 0.1.1
-------------------------
- a template project and makefile to simplify getting started with the library.
- New implementation of the model generator tool that now contains its own SCL file parser.
